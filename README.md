little：Toward Bias-Resilient Radiology Report Generation: Hierarchical Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Knowledge Graph Integration

## Code Release Plan

We currently provide the dataset preprocessing pipeline (scripts for data preparation and evaluation inputs) in this repository.

The complete codebase (training and inference) will be released upon acceptance / publication of the paper, together with configuration files and documentation to reproduce the main results.
